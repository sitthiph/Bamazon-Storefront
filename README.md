# Bamazon-Storefront
Creating an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers, deplete stock from the store's inventory, track product sales across your store's departments, and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store. This is used to learn MySQL and connecting it with Node.js.
